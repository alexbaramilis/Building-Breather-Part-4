# Building Breather (Part 4)

Breather is an open-source iOS app that shows the weather, air pollution and asthma conditions around you.
I'm building the app and writing a Medium series to raise awareness about air pollution 
and practice some of the latest knowledge I gain about iOS, Swift and programming.

This repo accompanies the Medium articles:
- [Part 4: Nested JSON Parsing with Decodable, CodingKeys and RxMoyaâ€™s filter and map.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-4-nested-json-parsing-with-decodable-codingkeys-and-rxmoyas-filter-and-515eef3265a5)
- [Part 4 - Bonus: Coming soon...]()
